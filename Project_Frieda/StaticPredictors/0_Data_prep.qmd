# Predicting temporal change from static patterns

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note: this is the first script used to study whether temporal change can be predicted from patterns that are collected once and do not change through time that we can find in nature (i.e., hereafter referred to as 'static pattern').\
Here we will prepare the data that will be used to predict temporal change.

In theory, it should be possible to partition the variance in species-level temporal change data into several factors that might play a role in the prediction. These 'predictors' are classified into several groups that describe different characteristics of the species, their ecological niche, their evolutionary history, the 'arena' which is being studied, and geometrical/statistical forces that could determine how the model predicts change.

The study's novelty derives from including geometrical, statistical and non-biological drivers in predicting temporal biodiversity change. The idea is that the statistical, geometrical, spatial and temporal limits of our study area and data collection might determine partially the result that can be predicted from the data.

We would expect that if a larger extent or a different scale is studied, temporal change patterns might depend on the situation. For example, in a small country, the magnitude of population increase is limited by the countries' borders, although the species range is most probably not (if there is no barrier or human intervention - e.g. Hunting). Thus, larger magnitudes of change can be detected on cross-border studies than it is structurally possible on a national scale.

\
In a similar manner, we would expect that the geometrical properties of our study area can determine the results that our models are able to predict. One example would be the distribution of the species range inside the country. Where the spread of a species across the 'arena' (i.e., study area) naturally limits the species range inside the arena by arbitrary (country) borders which might not match with ecological borders. In addition, solely due to geometrical constraints, more species can move northward with climate in a country that follows an elongated East-West direction compared to one that is North-South elongated. We suggest that the borders of the study area introduce a 'veil' to the actual underlying temporal change processes that are happening, thereby masking the true temporal change dynamics. However, since species assessments take place on a country scale, it may be possible to use the predictive strength of geometry and characteristics of the arena to enhance our predictive capacity on national scales.

-   used to calculate:

    -   spatial predictors

    -   characteristics of the 'arena'

    -   distribution / AOO of species

    -   Fractal dimension of a species' distribution
